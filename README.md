**Travix - Problem to be solved**

**Background:**

BusyFlights is a flights search solution which aggregates flight results initially from 2 different suppliers (CrazyAir and ToughJet). A future iteration (not part of the test) may add more suppliers.

**Recommended duration of test:**

Allocate no more than 90 minutes to complete this exercise. An incomplete solution is acceptable but documenting any remaining tasks and next steps is expected. 

**What is required:**

Use this GitHub repository as a base to implement the Busy Flights service that should produce an aggregated result from both CrazyAir and ToughJet.
The result should be a JSON response which contains a list of flights ordered by fare which has the following attributes:

**Busy Flights API**

**Request**

| Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| origin | 3 letter IATA code(eg. LHR, AMS) |
| destination | 3 letter IATA code(eg. LHR, AMS) |
| departureDate | ISO_LOCAL_DATE format |
| returnDate | ISO_LOCAL_DATE format |
| numberOfPassengers | Maximum 4 passengers |

**Response**

| Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| airline | Name of Airline |
| supplier | Eg: CrazyAir or ToughJet |
| fare | Total price rounded to 2 decimals |
| departureAirportCode | 3 letter IATA code(eg. LHR, AMS) |
| destinationAirportCode | 3 letter IATA code(eg. LHR, AMS) |
| departureDate | ISO_DATE_TIME format |
| arrivalDate | ISO_DATE_TIME format |

The service should connect to the both the suppliers using HTTP.

**CrazyAir API**

**Request**

| Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |

| returnDate | ISO_LOCAL_DATE format |
| passengerCount | Number of passengers |

**Response**

| ------ | ------ |
| airline | Name of the airline |
| price | Total price |
| cabinclass | E for Economy and B for Business |

**What you need to provide:**

- A solution that meets the above requirements.
- The implementation should be made as close to 'production ready' as possible within the time constraints.

It is fine to change any of the supplied application code, if you choose to do so please add comments to indicate what has changed and why.

**Note**
